As of c++11 there is no longer any reason for this library to be dependent on boost fusion, it would be better to
use variadic templates instead.

Dependency on boost python is only necessary for conversion to the easy-to-use boost python c++ emulation classes (list, tuple etc.) 
If we were willing to do away with this we could do all the python conversions with the python c interface.

Basicly there are two major projects here;

1) Replace boost fusion with c++11
2) Make it work with boost variants
